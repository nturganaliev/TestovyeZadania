let's assume that our table is called: students_details

1) to get the top 3 polyglot students and the number of languages that they know
   we do the following:

	SELECT name, COUNT(name)
	FROM students_details
	GROUP BY name
	LIMIT 3;

2) and to get the number of unique languages in our table,
   we use the following query:

   	SELECT DISTINCT language
   	FROM students_languages;
